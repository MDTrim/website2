<b>Understanding access to CS-A AP Exams in Massachusetts </b>

In my analysis, I have tried to determine if there is a relationship between school district wealth and access to and success on CS A AP exams. Because computer science is a field concerned with broadening its representation of various types of identity, and because UMass is a state Land Grant institution with a responsibility to educate our state's residents, I wanted to know if there seemed to be a way that the AP exam is creating more opportunities for those from wealthier districts. 

In my statistical analysis I was unable to find a meaningful correlation in the data provided on the State's Education website.  But, by examining just the top 20 districts in terms of number of exams taken, and correlating those districts with the median home price, I was able to determine that a disproportionate number of CS-A Exams are taken in districts with very high (at or above $1 million) median home values.
