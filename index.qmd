## Goals

With a background in theories of technology, rhetoric, technical communication, and a variety of other disciplinary interests, I want to use my skills to help others develop a critical lens for technology's impact on society. Empowering people to shape technology to suit their needs, rather than be shaped by it, continues to be a key motivator in my teaching, university service, volunteer, and scholarly work.
